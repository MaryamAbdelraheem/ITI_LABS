<h3>My Dog</h3>
 <img src="img.png" height="400" width="500" align="left"/> My dog Socha is my best friend. She likes to chose the soccer boll when I practica. It is so funny to see her running down the field trying to cotch the ball with her mouth. It just won't fit!

<p>Once Sosha saved my life. When I wos only 4 years old. I started to go into the street to get a ball that hod rolled across the street. Of course I did not think to look for cars! Sosha got in front of ine and krecked me backwards ento the sidewalk. I wes mod until I saw the car go by where I would have been.
Then I wos so happy that Sasha wes anarter than I was!</p>
